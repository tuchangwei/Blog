# Overview
I am a reliable senior mobile developer, I can make your iOS and Android Apps Elegant, Smooth, Funny and Great.

I started writing iOS apps in 2011, then I graduated in 2012 and got my Bachelor's Degree. I guess I started remote work officially from 2013 when my girl was born. I like tasting new technology, for example, I switched to the Swift language immediately when the Swift 0.1 was released. And I wrote my first Android app with Kotlin language before Google officially announced the Kotlin language as the first-class language on Android.

I use Vim to write code and Git to control code. RxSwift let me think everything as a stream, it also let me understand SwiftUI and Combine framework fast.

Besides mobile development, I am also interested in back-end development. In college, I learned PHP and Java for back-end development, but now I would like to use the Server-side Swift.

My Strengths:
✅ 100% Job Success
✅ 100% satisfaction from clients
✅ World-class quality and experience
✅ 24/7 available on Email or Skype
✅ 9+ years of iOS development experience
✅ 5+ years of Swift coding experience
✅ 5+ years of Remote work experience
✅ 2+ years of Kotlin coding experience
✅ Use Vim, RxSwift and RxJava to get the fast development speed and steady productions.
